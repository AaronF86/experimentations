# sample input data

.data
P:    .word 99
Q:    .word 101
.text
      la    $a0, P
      la    $a1, Q

CodeToTest:                   # label for running tests
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Registers $a0 and $a1 will contain pointers to words in memory.
# Read the words at memory locations $a0 and $a1, and place their
# product back into memory location $a0.

# â€¢ Multiply the two words together and store the resulting value back into the memory
#location pointed to by $a0. (thank for not putting this in comments)
